# 🦗 Cricket Chirps

**Cricket Chirps** is a fun and educational Android app that estimates the outdoor temperature based on the number of cricket chirps in 25 seconds. This phenomenon is based on **Dolbear’s Law**, which correlates chirp frequency to ambient temperature.

Built with **Kotlin** using **Android Studio**, this app features a simple UI and a straightforward formula to calculate temperature.
